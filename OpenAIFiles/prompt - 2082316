 *******************



Hey Friend,

I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to drop you a quick note to let you know how much I miss you. I know it's been a while since we've seen each other, but I still think about you every day.

I hope that you're taking good care of yourself, and that you're surrounded by people who love and support you. It's so important to have those things for our mental and physical health.

I'm also thinking of all the things we used to do together, like going out to eat, going to the movies, and having long conversations about everything. I miss those times, and I'm looking forward to doing them again soon.

I'm here for you if you need anything. You're such an important person in my life, and I hope you know how much I care about you.

Take care,

Your friend
